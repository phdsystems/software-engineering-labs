# Foundation Guide - SE Learning System

**Phase:** 0 - Foundation (Knowledge Base)
**Purpose:** Understanding fundamental software engineering principles
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Version:** 1.0

## TL;DR

**Core concept**: Software engineering principles are the fundamental truths that guide all design and implementation decisions. **Start here**: Learn SOLID, DRY, KISS, and YAGNI before writing complex systems. **Key insight**: Principles → Patterns → Architecture (bottom-up learning).

## Overview

This phase covers the foundational knowledge needed for software engineering excellence:
- **Design Principles** - The fundamental truths (SOLID, DRY, SoC, YAGNI, KISS)
- **First Principles Thinking** - Philosophy and approach
- **Learning Paths** - Structured roadmap from beginner to expert

## Learning Paths

### For Beginners (0-2 years experience)
1. Read [First Principles Approach](first-principles-approach.md)
2. Study [SOLID Principles](design-principle/solid-principle.md)
3. Learn [DRY](design-principle/dry-principle.md) and [Separation of Concerns](design-principle/separation-of-concerns.md)
4. Practice [YAGNI & KISS](design-principle/yagni-kiss.md)
5. Move to Phase 3: Design Patterns

### For Intermediate (2-5 years experience)
1. Review [Design Principle Overview](design-principle/overview.md)
2. Deep dive into [SOLID](design-principle/solid-principle.md) with real-world examples
3. Move to Phase 3: Architecture Patterns

### For Senior (5+ years experience)
1. Use as reference when teaching others
2. Review [First Principles Approach](first-principles-approach.md) for teaching methodology
3. Jump to Phase 3: Architecture Patterns

## Key Concepts

### What are Design Principles?

Design principles are **fundamental truths** that guide software design decisions:
- **SOLID** - Five principles for object-oriented design
- **DRY** - Don't duplicate knowledge
- **SoC** - Separate concerns for maintainability
- **YAGNI** - Don't build what you don't need
- **KISS** - Keep solutions simple

### Why Learn Principles First?

**Bottom-up learning approach:**
```
Level 0: Principles (WHY) ← Start here
    ↓
Level 1: Patterns (HOW)
    ↓
Level 2: Architecture (WHAT)
```

Principles are axioms - they don't change. Patterns and architectures are derived from these fundamental truths.

## Next Steps

After mastering foundation principles:
1. **Phase 3: Design** - Learn design patterns and architecture patterns
2. **Phase 4: Development** - See principles applied in 7 programming languages
3. **Phase 5: Testing** - Learn testing strategies that validate principles
